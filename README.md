# Airbnb Apartment Quality Predictor (Zero-Review Suggestion Engine)

A Data Science and Machine Learning project aimed at identifying newly posted Airbnb listings that are most likely to receive above-average guest evaluations. The model leverages property characteristics to proactively suggest high-quality accommodations to users when no reviews are yet available.

## 📌 Project Objective

- **Solve the "Cold-Start" Problem:** Develop a machine learning model capable of accurately assessing the likely quality of a newly listed Airbnb apartment (the "cold-start" problem) before it has accumulated any guest reviews.

- **Predict High Evaluation:** Classify new listings as either "High-Potential" or "Standard" based on the probability of achieving an above-average overall rating.

- **Identify Key Success Drivers:** Analyze and interpret which specific pre-review features are the strongest predictors of long-term guest satisfaction.

- **Support Early Recommendations:** Create a predictive system that can be integrated into a recommendation engine to suggest likely high-quality, trustworthy listings to users immediately upon posting.

- **Feature Engineering and Modeling:** Demonstrate a robust data science workflow, including data cleaning, feature engineering from raw listing data, and comparative analysis of various classification algorithms.
