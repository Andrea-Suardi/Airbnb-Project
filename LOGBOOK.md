# DECISIONI INIZIALI
Pros and Cons of Approaches:

- One City: Simplest for a personal project. Allows deep feature engineering, experimentation (e.g., XGBoost, neural nets, NLP on descriptions), and clear storytelling in your portfolio. You can focus on city-specific nuances (e.g., neighborhoods, regulations). Data volume is manageable—e.g., NYC has 40k+ listings per snapshot, enough for robust training without overwhelming compute. Easy to validate predictions using multiple temporal extracts.
- Multiple Cities Separately: Builds separate models per city. Good if you want to compare markets (e.g., how features like "proximity to landmarks" matter more in tourist-heavy cities). Shows scalability in your portfolio but increases workload (e.g., handling varying data quality, regulations like NYC's strict short-term rental laws). Use if you have time for 2-3 cities.
- All Cities Together: Pool data into one model, adding "city" as a categorical feature (or embeddings for similarity). Pros: More data (millions of listings), potentially better generalization. Cons: Markets differ wildly (e.g., pricing in Tokyo vs. Austin), leading to noisier models. Risk of confounding factors like currency, language, or seasonal tourism. Not ideal for cold-start validation across cities unless you normalize heavily.


## Leveraging Multiple Extractions for Validation:
This is a great idea! It's a realistic test bed for cold-start scenarios. For cities with historical data:

Identify "new" listings: Compare snapshots (e.g., listings in t=2024-06 but not in t=2024-03).
Predict their class ("High-Potential" if prob > threshold for above-average rating, say >4.5/5).
Validate: Use a future snapshot (e.g., t=2025-03) where those listings have reviews, compute accuracy/precision/recall/AUC against actual averages.
This mimics real deployment and strengthens your portfolio (e.g., "Achieved 75% accuracy on out-of-time test set").



## My CHOICE
Start with one city: New York City (NYC). Here's why:

High Relevance and Scale: ~40k-50k listings per snapshot, diverse neighborhoods (Manhattan vs. Brooklyn), and real-world challenges (e.g., regulations post-2023 reduced listings, which you can analyze). It's a benchmark city in Airbnb research, making your work comparable to papers/blogs.
Portfolio Appeal: A focused NYC project lets you showcase end-to-end skills (data cleaning, EDA, modeling, deployment via Streamlit/Flask). You can add visuals like maps (using Folium/Geopandas) of predicted high-potential areas. Mention expansion potential: "Future work: Adapt model to LA/SF for cross-market comparison."
Practicality: Data is free, well-documented, and includes geo-features for spatial analysis (e.g., distance to subways). Avoid smaller cities (e.g., Asheville) with sparse data/history.

ALSO focus on 3 snapshots for avaiability for free and where there is the variable review scores

## variabile target
Use review data to label listings as "High-Potential" (e.g., average rating > 4.5/5 or above median) or "Standard" for listings with sufficient reviews (e.g., ≥5 reviews to ensure reliable averages).

## validation workflow


Step 1: Select Snapshots:

Choose a training snapshot (e.g., t=2023-06) with listings and historical reviews to build your model. Use review data to label listings as "High-Potential" (e.g., average rating > 4.5/5 or above median) or "Standard" for listings with sufficient reviews (e.g., ≥5 reviews to ensure reliable averages).
Choose a prediction snapshot (e.g., t+1=2023-12) to identify "new" listings (those not in 2023-06). These simulate cold-start listings with no reviews at t+1.
Choose a validation snapshot (e.g., t+2=2024-06 or later, ideally 2024-12/2025-03) where new listings from t+1 have accumulated reviews. This lets you compute their actual average ratings to check your predictions.


Step 2: Preprocessing:

Training Data (2023-06): Merge listings and reviews. Filter listings with enough reviews to compute a reliable target label (e.g., mean rating > 4.5 = "High-Potential"). Engineer features: price, amenities (one-hot), description (TF-IDF), neighborhood (encoded), host_is_superhost, etc.
Prediction Data (2023-12): Identify new listings by comparing listing IDs (in 2023-12 but not 2023-06). Extract same features, no reviews needed (cold-start).
Validation Data (2024-06 or later): For those new listings, pull reviews to compute actual average ratings as ground truth.


Step 3: Model Training and Prediction:

Train a classifier (e.g., logistic regression, XGBoost) on 2023-06 data to predict "High-Potential" vs. "Standard" based on features.
Apply the model to new listings in 2023-12 to predict their class.


Step 4: Validation:

In 2024-06 (or later), compute actual average ratings for those predicted listings (if they have ≥5 reviews). Compare predicted class to actual (e.g., true if predicted "High-Potential" and rating > 4.5).
Metrics: Accuracy, precision (key for "High-Potential" to minimize false positives), recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC. Visualize confusion matrix.


Step 5: Iterate:

Test robustness by shifting snapshots (e.g., train on 2023-12, predict on 2024-06, validate on 2024-12). This shows your model generalizes across time.
