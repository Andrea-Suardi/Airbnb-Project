# COSE DA FARE
- una sola città? tante o tutte?
- quali città prendere dati?
  - sarebbe figo se potessi controllare se le mie previsioni si sono avverate o meno e quindi scegliere città che ha in almeno due snapshot le review scores
 
# DECISIONI INIZIALI
Pros and Cons of Approaches:

- One City: Simplest for a personal project. Allows deep feature engineering, experimentation (e.g., XGBoost, neural nets, NLP on descriptions), and clear storytelling in your portfolio. You can focus on city-specific nuances (e.g., neighborhoods, regulations). Data volume is manageable—e.g., NYC has 40k+ listings per snapshot, enough for robust training without overwhelming compute. Easy to validate predictions using multiple temporal extracts.
- Multiple Cities Separately: Builds separate models per city. Good if you want to compare markets (e.g., how features like "proximity to landmarks" matter more in tourist-heavy cities). Shows scalability in your portfolio but increases workload (e.g., handling varying data quality, regulations like NYC's strict short-term rental laws). Use if you have time for 2-3 cities.
- All Cities Together: Pool data into one model, adding "city" as a categorical feature (or embeddings for similarity). Pros: More data (millions of listings), potentially better generalization. Cons: Markets differ wildly (e.g., pricing in Tokyo vs. Austin), leading to noisier models. Risk of confounding factors like currency, language, or seasonal tourism. Not ideal for cold-start validation across cities unless you normalize heavily.


## Leveraging Multiple Extractions for Validation:
This is a great idea! It's a realistic test bed for cold-start scenarios. For cities with historical data:

Identify "new" listings: Compare snapshots (e.g., listings in t=2024-06 but not in t=2024-03).
Predict their class ("High-Potential" if prob > threshold for above-average rating, say >4.5/5).
Validate: Use a future snapshot (e.g., t=2025-03) where those listings have reviews, compute accuracy/precision/recall/AUC against actual averages.
This mimics real deployment and strengthens your portfolio (e.g., "Achieved 75% accuracy on out-of-time test set").



## My CHOICE
Start with one city: New York City (NYC). Here's why:

Rich Historical Data: NYC has the most extensive archives on Inside Airbnb—over 100 snapshots since 2015, with quarterly updates. This gives you plenty of temporal data for training/validation (e.g., use 2023-2024 for training, 2025 snapshots for testing predictions against real reviews). Other cities like London or LA have good history too, but NYC edges out with sheer volume and diversity.
High Relevance and Scale: ~40k-50k listings per snapshot, diverse neighborhoods (Manhattan vs. Brooklyn), and real-world challenges (e.g., regulations post-2023 reduced listings, which you can analyze). It's a benchmark city in Airbnb research, making your work comparable to papers/blogs.
Portfolio Appeal: A focused NYC project lets you showcase end-to-end skills (data cleaning, EDA, modeling, deployment via Streamlit/Flask). You can add visuals like maps (using Folium/Geopandas) of predicted high-potential areas. Mention expansion potential: "Future work: Adapt model to LA/SF for cross-market comparison."
Practicality: Data is free, well-documented, and includes geo-features for spatial analysis (e.g., distance to subways). Avoid smaller cities (e.g., Asheville) with sparse data/history.
